I recently finished my git course. So I need to create a note.
I will give you a title and you should write a short note including code examples for me. 
I need to put those notes in my website so, notes should be written in HTML. 

Here is your institutions :

Everything should be inside a HTML <article> element.
If you need to write a title, use <h2 tag> like, <h2>Title goes here</h2>.
Other text shound be inside <p> tag like <P>text goes here</p>.
If you need a line braek, use two <br/> tags.
If you need to write a code exmple, use this : <pre class="language-usedlanguage"><code>Code goes here</code></pre>.
If you need to add list, use <ol> and <li> tags.
Use <span> for one line of code, instead of <code> tag
Don't write more than 300 words
Everything should be inside a HTML <article> element. (important)

My first title is "35. Advanced Git concepts (rebase, cherry-pick, squash, etc.)".





I need to create a GIT for beginners course.
Give me a list of titles I should put in my course.
I need this course to be comprehensive (Course should contain a to z details about how to use git).
Your list should have more than 40 titles.
