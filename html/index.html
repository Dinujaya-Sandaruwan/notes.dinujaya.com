        <h2>01. What is CSS?</h2>
        <p
          >CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language
          used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or
          XML. CSS separates the content from presentation, making it easy to
          maintain and style documents on the web. Here's an example of how CSS
          is applied:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          /* Selects all h1 elements */
          h1 {
            font-size: 2em;
            color: #333;
            text-align: center;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the example above, the CSS selects all the
          <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> elements and applies the styles defined within
          the curly braces. The <span>font-size</span>, <span>color</span>, and
          <span>text-align</span> properties are set to <span>2em</span>,
          <span>#333</span>, and <span>center</span> respectively. This will
          make all <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> elements on the page have a font size
          of 2em, color of #333, and centered text alignment.</p
        >

        <h2>02. CSS History, Present & Future</h2>
        <p
          >CSS was first introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C). The first version of CSS, known as CSS1, was very basic and had
          limited styling capabilities. However, it paved the way for the
          development of modern CSS.</p
        >
        <p
          >Over the years, CSS has undergone several updates and enhancements,
          with CSS2 being released in 1998 and CSS3 in 1999. CSS3 is the latest
          version of CSS and includes new features like animations, gradients,
          and flexbox layouts.</p
        >
        <p
          >The future of CSS looks promising with ongoing development and
          updates. The latest version, CSS4, is currently in development and is
          expected to bring even more advanced features to CSS, including native
          support for variables, nesting, and more.</p
        >
        <p
          >Here's an example of using CSS3 to create a simple gradient
          background:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          /* Applies a linear gradient background to the body element */
          body {
            background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff, #ccc);
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >The above CSS code will create a gradient background for the
          <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> element, with the gradient going from white
          (#fff) at the top to light gray (#ccc) at the bottom.</p

        <h2>03. Adding CSS to our Project with Inline Styles</h2>
        <p
          >There are several ways to add CSS to an HTML document. One of the
          easiest ways is by using inline styles. Inline styles are defined
          within the HTML tag using the <span>style</span> attribute.</p
        >
        <p
          >Here's an example of adding inline styles to a
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> element:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-html"><code>
          &lt;p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #333;"&gt;This is a paragraph with inline styles.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the above example, the <span>style</span> attribute is added to
          the <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> tag with two CSS properties:
          <span>font-size</span> and <span>color</span>. The value for
          <span>font-size</span> is set to 1.2em and the value for
          <span>color</span> is set to #333.</p
        >
        <p
          >Inline styles are useful when you want to apply styles to individual
          elements, but they can become difficult to manage if you have a lot of
          styles or multiple pages with similar styles. In those cases, it's
          better to use an external stylesheet or internal styles within the
          <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> tag.</p

        <h2>04. Understanding the &lt;style&gt; Tag & Creating a .css File</h2>
        <p
          >The <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag is used to define styles within an
          HTML document. It can be used in two ways:</p
        >
        <ol>
          <li
            >Inline styles: The <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag can be added
            within the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> tag to define styles for the
            entire document.</li
          >
          <li
            >External stylesheets: The <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag can be
            used to link to an external stylesheet file that contains all the
            CSS styles for the document.</li
          >
        </ol>
        <p
          >Here's an example of using the <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag to
          define styles for a <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> element:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-html"><code>
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
              p {
                font-size: 1.2em;
                color: #333;
              }
            &lt;/style&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with styles defined in the &lt;style&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the above example, the <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag is added
          within the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> tag and contains CSS styles for
          the <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> element. The styles defined within the
          <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag will be applied to all
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> elements within the document.</p
        >
        <p
          >Alternatively, you can create an external CSS file with all the
          styles and link to it using the <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> tag. Here's
          an example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-html"><code>
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;

        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the above example, the <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> tag is used to
          link to an external CSS file named "styles.css". This file should
          contain all the CSS styles for the document.</p

        <h2>05. Applying Additional Styles & Importing Google Fonts</h2>
        <p
          >Now that we know how to add CSS styles to our HTML document, let's
          look at some additional styles we can apply and how to import external
          fonts using Google Fonts.</p
        >
        <p
          >Here's an example of applying some additional styles to a
          <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> element:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          div {
            background-color: #f5f5f5;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            padding: 10px;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the above example, we've added a background color, a border, and
          some padding to a <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> element. These styles will
          be applied to all <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> elements within the
          document.</p
        >
        <p
          >Next, let's look at how to import external fonts using Google Fonts.
          Here's an example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-html"><code>
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com"&gt;

            &lt;/style&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the above example, we've added three
          <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> tags to import the Google Fonts stylesheet.
          The first two <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> tags are used for
          preconnecting to Google Fonts and improving the font loading
          performance. The third <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> tag is used to import
          the Open Sans font family with two weights: 400 and 700.</p
        >
        <p
          >Finally, we've added a <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag within the
          <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> tag to apply the Open Sans font family to
          the entire document's body.</p

        <h2>06. CSS Selectors</h2>
        <p
          >CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply
          styles to them. Here are some examples of CSS selectors:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><span>Element Selector:</span> This targets all instances of a
            specific HTML element. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>p {
        color: red;
      }</code></pre>
          <li
            ><span>ID Selector:</span> This targets a specific HTML element with
            a unique ID. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>#header {
        background-color: blue;
      }</code></pre>
          <li
            ><span>Class Selector:</span> This targets all instances of a
            specific class in the HTML document. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>.container {
        max-width: 800px;
      }</code></pre>
          <li
            ><span>Attribute Selector:</span> This targets HTML elements based
            on their attributes. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>a[href="https://www.google.com"] {
        color: green;
      }</code></pre>
          <li
            ><span>Pseudo-class Selector:</span> This targets HTML elements
            based on their state, such as :hover or :active. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>a:hover {
        text-decoration: underline;
      }</code></pre>
        </ul>
        <p
          >By combining these selectors with CSS properties and values, we can
          apply styles to specific HTML elements and create visually appealing
          websites.</p

        <h2>07. Understanding the "Cascading" Style & Specificity</h2>
        <p
          >The term "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) refers to the
          way in which styles are applied to HTML elements. In simple terms,
          when multiple styles are applied to the same element, the browser
          determines which styles to use based on their specificity and the
          order in which they appear in the CSS code.</p
        >
        <p
          >Specificity refers to how "specific" a style selector is. The more
          specific a selector is, the higher its priority will be. Here are some
          examples of selectors and their specificity:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li><span>Element Selector:</span> Has a specificity of 1.</li>
          <li><span>Class Selector:</span> Has a specificity of 10.</li>
          <li><span>ID Selector:</span> Has a specificity of 100.</li>
          <li><span>Inline Style:</span> Has a specificity of 1000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p
          >When two or more selectors have the same specificity, the one that
          appears last in the CSS code will take precedence. Here's an
          example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          p {
            color: blue;
          }
          p {
            color: red;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In the above example, all <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> elements will have a
          red color, as the second rule appears last in the CSS code.</p
        >
        <p
          >Understanding specificity and the cascading style order is important
          for writing efficient and maintainable CSS code.</p
        >

        <h2>08. Understanding Inheritance</h2>
        <p
          >CSS inheritance is the process by which styles are passed down from
          parent elements to their child elements. This means that if a parent
          element has a certain style applied to it, that style will
          automatically be applied to its child elements unless they have their
          own styles defined.</p
        >
        <p>For example, consider the following HTML code:</p>
        <pre class="language-html"><code>
    &lt;div class="parent"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is some text&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
        <p
          >If we define a style for the <span>.parent</span> class like this:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
    .parent {
      color: blue;
    }
  </code></pre>
        <p
          >Then the <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> element inside the
          <span>&lt;div class="parent"&gt;</span> will also have a blue color,
          unless it has its own style defined. This is because the
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> element inherits the color property from its
          parent element.</p
        >
        <p
          >It's important to note that not all CSS properties are inherited. For
          example, properties related to layout or positioning are typically not
          inherited. To see if a particular property is inherited, you can check
          the CSS documentation for that property.</p
        >
        <p
          >Understanding inheritance can help you write more efficient and
          maintainable CSS code by reducing the amount of redundant code you
          need to write.</p

        <h2>09. Adding Combinators</h2>
        <p
          >CSS combinators are used to select elements based on their
          relationship to other elements. There are four types of combinators in
          CSS:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><span>Descendant Selector (space):</span> Selects an element that
            is a descendant of another element.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>Child Selector (>):</span> Selects an element that is a
            direct child of another element.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+):</span> Selects an element that
            is directly after another element.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>General Sibling Selector (~):</span> Selects all elements
            that come after another element.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >Here's an example of using the descendant selector to select all
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> elements inside a
          <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> element:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>

        <h2>10. Introducing the CSS Box Model</h2>
        <p
          >The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design that defines
          how HTML elements are displayed on a webpage. Every HTML element is
          essentially a rectangular box that consists of four parts:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><span>Content:</span> The actual content of the element, such as
            text or images.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>Padding:</span> The space between the content and the
            element's border.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>Border:</span> The line that surrounds the element's padding
            and content.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>Margin:</span> The space between the element's border and
            neighboring elements.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an example of how the box model is represented in CSS:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
    div {
      width: 200px;
      height: 100px;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 2px solid black;
      margin: 10px;
    }
  </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code will create a <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> element that is 200
          pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. It will have 20 pixels of padding, a
          2 pixel border that is solid and black, and 10 pixels of margin around
          the entire element.</p
        >
        <p
          >Understanding the box model is crucial for creating layouts and
          positioning elements on a webpage. It can also help you troubleshoot
          layout issues and understand how different CSS properties affect an
          element's size and position.</p

        <h2
          >11. Understanding Margin Collapsing and Removing Default Margins</h2
        >
        <p
          >Margin collapsing is a phenomenon that occurs when two adjacent
          elements have vertical margins. In some cases, the margins will
          "collapse" into a single margin that is equal to the larger of the two
          margins. This can be confusing and unexpected, but it is an important
          concept to understand.</p
        >
        <p
          >To avoid margin collapsing, you can use one of several techniques:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li>Use padding instead of margin on one of the elements.</li>
          <li>Add a border or padding to one of the elements.</li>
          <li>Add a non-zero height to one of the elements.</li>
          <li
            >Add a non-zero float or position property to one of the
            elements.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >Another important aspect of margins is that many HTML elements have
          default margins that can interfere with your layout. For example, the
          <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> element typically has a margin around the
          entire page, which can cause issues if you're trying to create a
          full-width layout.</p
        >
        <p>To remove default margins, you can use the following CSS code:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          body {
            margin: 0;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code will set the margin of the
          <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> element to zero, effectively removing any
          default margin. You can also use this technique with other elements
          that have default margins, such as <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> or
          <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>.</p

        <h2>12. Working with Shorthand Properties</h2>
        <p
          >In CSS, shorthand properties allow you to specify multiple related
          properties in a single line of code. This can make your code shorter
          and easier to read, but it's important to understand how shorthand
          properties work so that you can use them effectively.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of a shorthand property:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code sets the margin of an element to 10 pixels on the top, 20
          pixels on the right, 10 pixels on the bottom, and 20 pixels on the
          left. The order of the values is top, right, bottom, left, going
          clockwise around the element.</p
        >
        <p
          >Another example of a shorthand property is the
          <span>font</span> property:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          font: italic small-caps bold 16px/1.5 Arial, sans-serif;
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code sets several properties related to the font of an element,
          including the font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size,
          line-height, and font-family. The values are listed in a specific
          order, and not all values are required.</p
        >
        <p
          >Using shorthand properties can save you time and help keep your code
          organized, but it's important to be aware of the properties you're
          setting and the order in which they're listed.</p

        <h2>13. Diving Into the Height & Width Properties</h2>
        <p
          >The <span>height</span> and <span>width</span> properties in CSS
          allow you to set the height and width of an element. These properties
          are commonly used for layout purposes, such as setting the size of a
          container or an image.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to use these properties:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          .container {
            width: 500px;
            height: 300px;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code sets the width of the element with the class of "container"
          to 500 pixels and the height to 300 pixels. You can also use other
          units of measurement, such as percentages or ems, to set the height
          and width.</p
        >
        <p
          >It's important to note that the height and width properties only set
          the dimensions of the content box of an element, not including any
          padding, border, or margin. If you want to set the size of the entire
          element, including padding and border, you can use the
          <span>box-sizing</span> property:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          .container {
            box-sizing: border-box;
            width: 500px;
            height: 300px;
            padding: 20px;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code sets the box-sizing property to border-box, which includes
          the padding and border in the width and height of the element. This
          means that the content box will be 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels
          high, including the 20-pixel padding and 1-pixel border on each
          side.</p

        <h2>14. Understanding Box Sizing</h2>
        <p
          >The <span>box-sizing</span> property in CSS allows you to control how
          the size of an element is calculated, taking into account its padding
          and border.</p
        >
        <p
          >The default value of the <span>box-sizing</span> property is
          <span>content-box</span>, which means that the width and height
          properties only apply to the content box of the element, not including
          its padding and border.</p
        >
        <p
          >If you want to include the padding and border in the width and height
          of the element, you can set the <span>box-sizing</span> property to
          <span>border-box</span>:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
          .container {
            box-sizing: border-box;
            width: 500px;

            padding: 20px;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This code sets the <span>box-sizing</span> property to
          <span>border-box</span>, which means that the width and height
          properties now include the padding and border of the element. The
          resulting element will have a content box of 460 pixels wide (500 - 2
          * 20 - 2 * 1) and 260 pixels high (300 - 2 * 20 - 2 * 1), with a total
          width of 500 pixels and a total height of 300 pixels.</p
        >
        <p
          >It's important to note that changing the
          <span>box-sizing</span> property can affect the layout of your entire

        <h2>15. Understanding the Display Property</h2>
        <p
          >The <span>display</span> property in CSS controls how an element is
          displayed on a web page. There are several values that the
          <span>display</span> property can take:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li><span>block</span>: the element generates a block-level box.</li>
          <li
            ><span>inline</span>: the element generates an inline-level box.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>inline-block</span>: the element generates a block-level box
            that will flow with the surrounding text as if it were an inline
            element.</li
          >
          <li
            ><span>none</span>: the element is completely removed from the page
            and takes up no space.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >The default value for most HTML elements is <span>block</span>, which
          means that they will take up the entire width of their container and
          create a new line after them. However, there are some exceptions, such
          as <span>inline</span> elements like <span>&lt;a&gt;</span> and
          <span>&lt;span&gt;</span>.</p
        >
        <p
          >The <span>display</span> property can also be used to create
          responsive designs by changing the layout of elements depending on the
          size of the screen. For example, you can set an element to
          <span>block</span> on desktop screens and <span>inline-block</span> on
          mobile screens to create a more compact layout.</p
        >

        <h2>16. Styling Anchor Tags</h2>
        <p
          >Anchor tags (<span>&lt;a&gt;</span>) are commonly used in web design
          to create hyperlinks to other pages or resources. To style anchor
          tags, you can use the <span>:link</span>, <span>:visited</span>, and
          <span>:hover</span> pseudo-classes.</p
        >
        <p
          >The <span>:link</span> pseudo-class is used to style links that have
          not been visited by the user, while the
          <span>:visited</span> pseudo-class is used to style links that have
          already been visited. The <span>:hover</span> pseudo-class is used to
          style links when the user hovers over them with their mouse.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to style anchor tags:</p>
        <pre class="language-css">
<code>a:link {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:visited {
  color: purple;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, the <span>:link</span> pseudo-class sets the color
          of unvisited links to blue and removes the underline, while the
          <span>:visited</span> pseudo-class sets the color of visited links to
          purple. The <span>:hover</span> pseudo-class underlines the link when
          the user hovers over it.</p
        >
        <p
          >You can also style anchor tags using other CSS properties, such as
          <span>font-size</span>, <span>background-color</span>, and
          <span>padding</span>, to create custom link styles that match your

        <h2>20. Using Multiple CSS Classes & Combined Selectors</h2>
        <p
          >You can apply multiple CSS classes to an HTML element by including
          all the classes in the <code>class</code> attribute, separated by a
          space. Each class can have its own styles, which are combined when
          applied to the element.</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-html"
        ><code>&lt;div class="box red"&gt;This is a red box&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
.red {
  background-color: red;
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, the <code>.box</code> class defines the width,
          height, and border of the element, while the <code>.red</code> class
          adds a red background to the element. When both classes are applied to
          the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, the styles from both classes are
          combined to create a red box with a border.</p
        >
        <p
          >You can also use combined selectors to apply styles to elements that
          meet multiple criteria. For example, the following selector will apply
          styles to all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements with a class of
          <code>external</code> that are located within a
          <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>nav a.external {
  color: red;
}</code></pre>
        <p
          >Combined selectors can be very powerful and allow you to create very
          specific styles for specific elements in your HTML structure.</p

        <h2>21. Classes or IDs?</h2>
        <p
          >When selecting elements in CSS, you have two options: classes and
          IDs. Both have their uses and are appropriate in different
          situations.</p
        >
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p
          >Classes are used to group elements that share a common style. You can
          apply the same class to multiple elements, and each element will
          inherit the styles defined for that class.</p

  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;

          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements, both of which are styled with a bold
          font weight and red text color.</p
        >
        <h3>IDs</h3>
        <p
          >IDs are used to uniquely identify an element on a page. Unlike
          classes, each ID can only be used once per page, and should be used
          sparingly to avoid conflicts.</p
        >
        <pre

          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, which is styled with a black
          background and white text color.</p
        >
        <h3>When to Use Classes vs. IDs</h3>
        <p
          >As a general rule, you should use classes when you want to apply a
          style to multiple elements on a page, and IDs when you want to
          uniquely identify a single element. However, there are exceptions to
          this rule, and it's ultimately up to you to decide which to use based
          on the specific needs of your project.</p

        <h2>22. (Not) using !important</h2>
        <p
          >The <code>!important</code> keyword is used to give a CSS declaration
          more weight than normal. When an !important declaration is used, it
          will override any other declarations for that property on that
          element, regardless of specificity.</p
        >
        <p
          >While <code>!important</code> can be a useful tool in certain
          situations, it should be used sparingly and with caution. Overuse of
          <code>!important</code> can make it difficult to debug and maintain
          your CSS, and can lead to unexpected and unintended results.</p
        >
        <h3>When to Use !important</h3>
        <p
          >There are some situations where <code>!important</code> can be a
          useful tool:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >When you need to override a style applied by a third-party library

            of specificity.</li

        </ul>
        <h3>When Not to Use !important</h3>
        <p
          >On the other hand, there are many situations where
          <code>!important</code> should be avoided:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >When there are other, more specific selectors that could be used
            instead.</li
          >
          <li
            >When you are working on a large project where it could be difficult

            <code>!important</code>.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >Remember, <code>!important</code> should be used only when necessary
          and with caution. It's always better to rely on specificity and
          careful use of selectors to achieve the desired style.</p

        <h2>24. CSS & Browser Support</h2>
        <p
          >One of the biggest challenges when working with CSS is ensuring that
          your styles are properly displayed across different browsers. While
          modern browsers generally support the same CSS features, older
          browsers may have limited or no support for some properties or
          selectors. Here are a few tips to help ensure cross-browser
          compatibility:</p
        >
        <ol>
          <li
            >Check the compatibility of CSS features you plan to use on
            <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> to see which browsers
            support them.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use feature detection to apply styles selectively based on browser
            support. For example, you can use the <code>@supports</code> rule to
            apply styles only if a certain CSS feature is supported by the
            browser:</li
          >
        </ol>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>@supports (display: grid) {
        /* styles for browsers that support CSS Grid */
      }</code></pre>
        <ol start="3">
          <li
            >Avoid using proprietary prefixes (such as -webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, or
            -o-) whenever possible, as they are specific to certain browsers and
            may become obsolete over time.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use CSS resets or normalizers to ensure consistent styles across
            different browsers. These tools help to eliminate the default styles
            that different browsers apply to HTML elements, giving you a clean
            slate to work with.</li
          >
        </ol>
        <p
          >By following these tips and staying up-to-date on the latest CSS
          features and browser support, you can create styles that look great
          across a wide range of devices and browsers.</p

        <h2>25. Understanding the Z-Index</h2>
        <p
          >The z-index property is used to specify the stack order of positioned
          elements that overlap within a document. Elements with a higher
          z-index value will appear on top of elements with a lower z-index
          value. Here are some important things to keep in mind when using the
          z-index property:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >The z-index property only works on positioned elements (elements
            with position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or
            position: sticky).</li
          >
          <li
            >The z-index property can take any integer value (positive or
            negative).</li
          >
          <li
            >The default value of the z-index property is auto, which means that
            the element will be positioned in the normal document flow and will
            not be affected by the z-index values of other elements.</li
          >
          <li
            >The z-index property can be used in conjunction with other CSS
            properties like opacity and transform, as long as the element is
            positioned.</li
          >
          <li
            >When two elements overlap and have the same z-index value, the one
            that appears later in the HTML document (i.e. appears lower in the
            code) will be placed on top.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Here is an example of how to use the z-index property:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>.box {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}
.box2 {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, the .box2 element will appear on top of the .box
          element because it has a higher z-index value.</p

        <h2>26. CSS Sizes and Units</h2>
        <p
          >When styling with CSS, it's important to choose the appropriate size
          and unit for your properties. Here are some of the most common units
          used in CSS:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >px (pixels) - A pixel is a single dot on a screen. This unit is
            commonly used for specifying font sizes and element dimensions. For
            example, "font-size: 16px" or "width: 300px".</li
          >
          <li
            >% (percentages) - A percentage is a relative unit that is based on
            the size of the parent element. For example, "width: 50%" will make
            an element take up half the width of its parent element.</li
          >
          <li
            >em - An em is a unit that is based on the size of the font that is
            being used. For example, if the font-size of an element is 16px,
            then 1em is equal to 16px. This unit is commonly used for setting
            line-heights and spacing between elements.</li
          >
          <li
            >rem - A rem is similar to an em, but it is based on the size of the
            root element (i.e. the HTML element) rather than the current
            element. This unit is commonly used for creating scalable layouts
            that can be easily adjusted for different screen sizes.</li
          >
          <li
            >vh and vw - These units are based on the size of the viewport (i.e.
            the visible area of the browser window). 1vh is equal to 1% of the
            viewport height, while 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
            These units are commonly used for creating full-screen layouts or
            for setting element sizes relative to the viewport.</li

        <h2>27. Where Units Matter</h2>
        <p
          >When it comes to sizing elements in CSS, choosing the right unit is
          important to achieve the desired result. Here are some cases where
          units matter:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><b>Font size:</b> The most commonly used unit for font sizes is
            <code>px</code>. However, using <code>em</code> or
            <code>rem</code> is recommended because they are relative units and
            allow for more responsive design. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>body {
  font-size: 16px;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 2em; /* equivalent to 32px */
}

p {
  font-size: 1rem; /* equivalent to 16px */
}</code></pre>
          <li
            ><b>Padding and margin:</b> Padding and margin can be specified in
            <code>px</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>%</code>,
            and other units. <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> are again
            recommended for responsive design. For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>.box {
    padding: 1em;
    margin: 0.5rem;
}</code></pre>
          <li
            ><b>Width and height:</b> The most commonly used units for
            specifying width and height are <code>px</code> and <code>%</code>.
            <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> can also be used, but they are
            relative units and can cause unexpected results in certain cases.
            For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>.container {
    width: 100%;
    height: 400px;
}
    
    .box {
    width: 50%; /* of the parent container /
    height: 2em;
}</code></pre>
          <li
            ><b>Viewport units:</b> Viewport units are relative to the size of
            the viewport and can be useful for creating responsive designs. The
            most commonly used viewport units are <code>vw</code> (viewport
            width) and <code>vh</code> (viewport height). For example:</li
          >
          <pre class="language-css"><code>.box {
    width: 50vw; / 50% of the viewport width /
    height: 50vh; / 50% of the viewport height */
}</code></pre>
        </ul>
        <p
          >By choosing the right unit for each case, you can make your CSS more
          flexible and responsive to different screen sizes and devices.</p

        <h2>28. CSS for Styling Forms</h2>
        <p
          >CSS can be used to style HTML forms, including input fields,
          checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons.</p
        >
        <p>For example, to style an input field:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>input {
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
    border: none;
    padding: 12px 15px;
    margin: 8px 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}</code></pre>
        <p>The CSS properties used above are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li
            ><span>background-color</span>: sets the background color of the
            input field.</li
          >
          <li><span>border</span>: sets the border of the input field.</li>
          <li
            ><span>padding</span>: sets the padding inside the input field.</li
          >
          <li><span>margin</span>: sets the margin outside the input field.</li>
          <li
            ><span>box-sizing</span>: sets how the width and height of the input
            field are calculated (in this case, including the border and
            padding).</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Similarly, checkboxes and radio buttons can be styled:</p>

        <h2>29. Styling Fonts</h2>
        <p
          >There are several properties in CSS that can be used to style
          fonts:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><code>font-family</code>: specifies the font(s) to be used for the
            text</li
          >
          <li><code>font-size</code>: specifies the size of the font</li>
          <li
            ><code>font-weight</code>: specifies the weight (boldness) of the
            font</li
          >
          <li
            ><code>font-style</code>: specifies the style (italic, oblique,
            etc.) of the font</li
          >
          <li
            ><code>text-transform</code>: specifies the capitalization of the
            text</li
          >
          <li
            ><code>text-decoration</code>: specifies the decoration of the text
            (underline, overline, line-through, etc.)</li
          >
          <li
            ><code>text-align</code>: specifies the horizontal alignment of the
            text</li
          >
          <li
            ><code>line-height</code>: specifies the distance between lines of
            text</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an example of how to use some of these properties:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
    p {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

        line-height: 1.5;
    }
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >This will style all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements on the page with
          Arial (or a sans-serif font if Arial isn't available), a size of 16
          pixels, a normal weight, italic style, uppercase letters, underlined
          text, centered alignment, and a line height of 1.5 times the font
          size.</p

        <h2>30. Why our Project Should Become Responsive</h2>
        <p
          >With the increasing usage of mobile devices, it's more important than
          ever to ensure that our web projects are responsive. Responsive design
          means that our website can adapt to different screen sizes and device
          types, providing a better user experience for all users.</p
        >
        <p>There are many benefits to creating a responsive website:</p>
        <ol>
          <li
            >Improved user experience: Users can access your site from any
            device, and it will look and function properly.</li
          >
          <li
            >Increased traffic: Google rewards responsive websites with higher
            search engine rankings.</li
          >
          <li
            >Cost-effective: Rather than creating separate websites for desktop
            and mobile, responsive design allows you to create one website that
            works for all devices.</li
          >
        </ol>
        <p
          >In order to make our project responsive, we need to use CSS media
          queries. Media queries allow us to apply different styles based on the
          screen size of the device being used. We can use media queries to
          adjust our layout, font sizes, and even hide or show elements
          depending on the device screen size.</p
        >
        <pre class="language-css"><code>
        /* Example of a media query */
        @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
          /* Styles applied to devices with a maximum width of 600px */
          body {
            font-size: 14px;
          }
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p

        <h2>31. Understanding Hardware Pixels vs. Software Pixels</h2>
        <p
          >When we talk about screens and displays, there are two types of
          pixels: hardware pixels and software pixels.
        </p>
        <p
          >Hardware pixels are the physical dots that make up a screen, and
          their size and density are fixed, meaning that a screen with a
          resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels will always have 1920 x 1080 physical
          pixels. On the other hand, software pixels, or logical pixels, are the
          units used by software to render content on the screen.
        </p>
        <p
          >One important concept related to software pixels is the device pixel
          ratio (DPR). This is the ratio between the physical size of a pixel
          and its logical size. For example, if a screen has a DPR of 2, this
          means that each logical pixel is represented by 2 physical pixels.
        </p>
        <p
          >Understanding hardware and software pixels is important when it comes
          to creating responsive designs that look good on different devices.
          When we specify dimensions and positions in CSS, we should use logical
          units like em, rem, or %, rather than physical units like px, because
          logical units will adjust to the DPR of the device and look consistent
          across different screens.

          >32. Comparing the Viewport Metatag (HTML) and Media Queries (CSS)</h2
        >
        <p
          >Both the viewport metatag and media queries are used to make a
          website responsive.</p
        >
        <p
          >The viewport metatag is used in HTML to control the width and scaling
          of the viewport on mobile devices. It specifies the viewport's width,
          the initial scale, and maximum scale. For example:</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-html"
        ><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"&gt;</code></pre>
        <p
          >The above meta tag sets the viewport width to be the same as the
          device width, and disables zooming.</p
        >
        <p
          >Media queries, on the other hand, are used in CSS to apply different
          styles depending on the device width. They allow us to create a
          responsive design by defining different styles for different devices.
          For example:</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-css"
        ><code>@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for devices with a maximum width of 768px */
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* Styles for devices with a minimum width of 769px and maximum width of 1024px */
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
  /* Styles for devices with a minimum width of 1025px */
}</code></pre>
        <p
          >The above media queries define three different sets of styles for
          devices with different screen sizes. The first set of styles applies
          to devices with a maximum width of 768px, the second set of styles
          applies to devices with a minimum width of 769px and a maximum width
          of 1024px, and the third set of styles applies to devices with a
          minimum width of 1025px.</p
        >
        <p
          >By using both the viewport metatag and media queries, we can create a
          fully responsive website that looks great on all devices.</p

        <h2>33. Understanding the "viewport" Metatag</h2>
        <p
          >The <code>viewport</code> meta tag is used to specify the viewport
          for mobile browsers. It helps the browser to adjust the page layout
          according to the size of the device screen.</p
        >
        <p
          >The viewport meta tag is placed inside the <code>head</code> section
          of your HTML document. Here is an example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
      </code></pre>
        <p
          >The <code>content</code> attribute is used to define the settings for
          the viewport. In the example above, we set the width of the viewport
          to the device width and set the initial zoom level to 1.0. This means
          that the webpage will be displayed with a 1:1 ratio between CSS pixels
          and device-independent pixels.</p
        >
        <p
          >By using the viewport meta tag, we can make sure that our web page
          looks good on all devices, from small smartphones to large desktop
          screens.</p

        <h2>34. Designing Websites "Mobile First"</h2>
        <p
          >Mobile-first design is a web design strategy in which mobile devices
          are the first priority when designing a website. It involves designing
          the website for smaller screen sizes first and then gradually scaling
          up to larger screens. This approach has become increasingly popular
          because mobile devices account for a significant portion of web
          traffic, and it's essential to ensure that your website is optimized
          for smaller screens.</p
        >
        <p
          >One of the main advantages of mobile-first design is that it
          encourages simplicity and efficiency. It forces designers to focus on
          the most critical elements of the website and avoid unnecessary
          clutter that can slow down the page's load time. Additionally, it can
          also help ensure that the website is more accessible to people with
          disabilities and older devices.</p
        >
        <p
          >Mobile-first design can be achieved using responsive design
          techniques. A responsive website is one that adjusts its layout and
          content based on the screen size and orientation of the device being
          used. This is achieved using CSS media queries, which allow you to
          specify different styles for different screen sizes.</p
        >
        <p
          >By designing with mobile devices in mind first, you can create a
          website that is optimized for a wide range of devices and screen
          sizes, which can ultimately lead to a better user experience and
          increased engagement.</p
