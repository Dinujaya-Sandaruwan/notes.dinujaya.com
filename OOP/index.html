        <h2>01. What is OOP?</h2>
        <p
          >Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is
          based on the concept of objects. An object is a data structure that
          has properties and methods associated with it. Properties represent
          the state of the object, while methods represent the behavior of the
          object. OOP allows developers to organize code into reusable and
          modular structures.</p
        >
        <p
          >In JavaScript, objects can be created using the
          <span>Object()</span> constructor or using object literals. Here is an
          example of an object literal:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>
          const person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            age: 30,
            fullName: function() {
              return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            }
          };
          console.log(person.fullName()); // "John Doe"
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >In this example, we create an object called <span>person</span> with
          four properties: <span>firstName</span>, <span>lastName</span>,
          <span>age</span>, and <span>fullName</span>. The
          <span>fullName</span> property is a function that returns the full
          name of the person by concatenating the first and last name
          properties.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>02. Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
        <p
          >There are four main concepts, known as the four pillars of OOP, that
          guide developers in designing and implementing object-oriented
          software:</p
        >
        <ol>
          <li
            ><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The process of grouping data and
            methods that act on that data within a single unit, called a class.
            This concept allows us to control access to data and prevent
            unintended changes.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Inheritance:</strong> The process of creating new classes
            by inheriting properties and methods from parent classes.
            Inheritance allows us to reuse code and create a hierarchy of
            classes.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of objects to take on
            multiple forms. Polymorphism allows us to write more generic and
            flexible code, making it easier to extend and maintain.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The process of identifying the
            essential features of an object and ignoring the rest. Abstraction
            allows us to simplify complex systems and focus on the most
            important aspects.</li
          >
        </ol>
        <p
          >By understanding and applying these four concepts, developers can
          create more organized, maintainable, and extensible code.</p
        >

        <h2>03. Setting Up the Development Environment</h2>
        <p
          >Before diving into object-oriented programming with JavaScript, it's
          important to set up a development environment. Here are the steps to
          follow:</p
        >
        <ol>
          <li
            ><strong>Install a text editor:</strong> Choose a text editor to
            write your code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code,
            Sublime Text, and Atom.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Install Node.js:</strong> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime
            that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. It
            includes a package manager called npm, which is used to install
            libraries and frameworks. You can download Node.js from the official
            website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Create a new project:</strong> Create a new directory for
            your project and initialize it with npm by running the following
            command in your terminal: <span>npm init</span>. This will create a
            <span>package.json</span> file in your directory that will track
            your project's dependencies and other metadata.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Install dependencies:</strong> Install any libraries or
            frameworks that you want to use in your project using npm. For
            example, to install the popular testing framework Jest, run the
            command <span>npm install jest --save-dev</span>. The
            <span>--save-dev</span> flag saves the package as a development
            dependency.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Write some code:</strong> Open your text editor and start
            writing some code! You can run your JavaScript code using Node.js in
            the terminal by running the command
            <span>node path/to/your/file.js</span>.</li
          >
        </ol>
        <p
          >By following these steps, you'll have a development environment set
          up and ready to start building object-oriented JavaScript
          applications.</p
        >

      <article>
        <h2>04. Object Literals</h2>
        <p
          >Object literals are a convenient way to create and initialize objects
          in JavaScript. Here's an example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const person = {
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 30,
        address: {
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown',
          state: 'CA',
          zip: '12345'
        },
        sayHello() {
          console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
        }
      };</code></pre>
        <p
          >In this example, we've created an object called
          <span>person</span> with several properties and a method. The
          properties are defined using key-value pairs, where the key is the
          property name and the value is the property value. We've also defined
          a nested object called <span>address</span> and a method called
          <span>sayHello</span>.</p
        >
        <p
          >We can access the properties and methods of the object using dot
          notation, like this:</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-javascript"
        ><code>console.log(person.name); // Output: John Doe
      person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe</code></pre>
        <p
          >Object literals are a powerful tool for creating and working with
          objects in JavaScript.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>05. Factories</h2>
        <p
          >In object-oriented programming, a factory is a function or method
          that creates and returns objects of a particular type. Here's an
          example of a factory function in JavaScript:</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-javascript"
        ><code>function createPerson(name, age) {
        return {
          name: name,
          age: age,
          sayHello() {
            console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
          }
        };
      }</code></pre>
        <p
          >In this example, we've defined a factory function called
          <span>createPerson</span> that takes two arguments:
          <span>name</span> and <span>age</span>. The function creates and
          returns an object with properties for name and age, as well as a
          <span>sayHello</span> method.</p
        >
        <p
          >We can use the factory function to create new person objects like
          this:</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-javascript"
        ><code>const person1 = createPerson('John Doe', 30);
      const person2 = createPerson('Jane Smith', 25);
      person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe
      person2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane Smith</code></pre>

        <p
          >Factories provide a way to encapsulate object creation and provide a
          simpler interface for creating new objects. They can be particularly
          useful when we need to create multiple objects of the same type.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>06. Constructors</h2>
        <p
          >In JavaScript, constructors are special functions that are used to
          create new objects with the same properties and methods. Constructors
          are invoked using the <span>new</span> keyword, and they are
          conventionally named with a capitalized first letter.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of a constructor function in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      this.sayHello = function() {
      console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
      }
      }</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we've defined a constructor function called
          <span>Person</span> that takes two arguments: <span>name</span> and
          <span>age</span>. The function creates and initializes a new object
          with properties for name and age, as well as a
          <span>sayHello</span> method.</p
        >
        <p
          >We can use the constructor function to create new person objects like
          this:</p
        >
        <pre
          class="language-javascript"
        ><code>const person1 = new Person('John Doe', 30);
      const person2 = new Person('Jane Smith', 25);
      person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe
      person2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane Smith</code></pre>

        <p
          >Constructors provide a way to create objects with the same properties
          and methods. They are particularly useful when we need to create
          multiple objects of the same type.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>07. Constructor Property</h2>
        <p
          >Every object in JavaScript has a <span>constructor</span> property
          that refers to the constructor function that was used to create the
          object. This property can be accessed and modified like any other
          object property.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
      const person = new Person('John Doe', 30);
      
      console.log(person.constructor); // Output: ƒ Person(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; }</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we've defined a constructor function called
          <span>Person</span> that creates and initializes a new object with
          properties for name and age. We then create a new person object using
          the constructor function, and log the value of the
          <span>constructor</span> property to the console.</p
        >
        <p
          >The <span>constructor</span> property can be useful for checking the
          type of an object. For example, we can use it to determine if an
          object was created using a particular constructor function:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function Dog(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
      const dog = new Dog('Fido');
      
      console.log(dog.constructor === Dog); // Output: true</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we've defined a constructor function called
          <span>Dog</span> that creates and initializes a new object with a
          property for name. We then create a new dog object using the
          constructor function, and check if the value of the
          <span>constructor</span> property is equal to the
          <span>Dog</span> function.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>08. Functions are Objects</h2>
        <p
          >In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. This means that
          functions can be treated like any other object, such as being assigned
          to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, or returned from
          functions.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function greet(name) {
        console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
      }
      greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John!
      
      const myGreet = greet;
      
      myGreet('Jane'); // Output: Hello, Jane!</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we've defined a function called
          <span>greet</span> that logs a greeting to the console. We then assign
          the function to a new variable called <span>myGreet</span>, and call
          it with a different name argument.</p
        >
        <p
          >Functions can also have properties, just like any other object.
          Here's an example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function greet(name) {
        console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
      }
      greet.language = 'English';
      
      console.log(greet.language); // Output: English</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we've defined a function called
          <span>greet</span> that logs a greeting to the console. We then set a
          property called <span>language</span> on the function, and log the
          value of the property to the console.</p
        >
        <p
          >Functions are powerful objects in JavaScript, and their ability to be
          treated as data allows for a wide range of programming techniques.</p
        >

      <article>
        <h2>09. Value vs Reference Types</h2>
        <p
          >When working with variables in JavaScript, it's important to
          understand the difference between value types and reference types.
          Value types store the actual value in the variable, while reference
          types store a reference to an object in memory.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>// Value type
      let x = 10;
      let y = x;
      x = 20;
      console.log(x); // Output: 20
      console.log(y); // Output: 10
      
      // Reference type
      let a = { value: 10 };
      let b = a;
      a.value = 20;
      
      console.log(a.value); // Output: 20
      console.log(b.value); // Output: 20</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we have two variables <span>x</span> and
          <span>y</span> that both contain a value type (a number). When we
          assign the value of <span>x</span> to <span>y</span> and change the
          value of <span>x</span>, the value of <span>y</span> remains
          unchanged. This is because the value of <span>x</span> is copied into
          <span>y</span> and the two variables are independent of each other.</p
        >
        <p
          >On the other hand, we have two variables <span>a</span> and
          <span>b</span> that both contain a reference type (an object). When we
          assign the reference of <span>a</span> to <span>b</span> and change a
          property of <span>a</span>, the property of <span>b</span> is also
          changed. This is because <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> both
          reference the same object in memory.</p
        >
        <p
          >Understanding value types and reference types is important when
          working with complex data structures in JavaScript, such as arrays and
          objects.</p

        <h2>10. Adding or Removing Properties</h2>
        <p
          >In JavaScript, you can add or remove properties to objects at any
          time, even after they have been created. This can be useful when you
          need to dynamically update an object based on user input or other
          variables.</p
        >
        <p
          >To add a new property to an object, you can simply assign a value to
          a new property name:</p

        name: 'John',

        <h2>11. Enumerating Properties</h2>
        <p

          using a <span>for...in</span> loop. This can be useful when you need
          to iterate over all the properties of an object or when you need to
          check if a specific property exists in an object.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>let person = {

          >In this example, we use a <span>for...in</span> loop to iterate over
          all the properties of the <span>person</span> object. For each
          property, we log the property name and its value to the console.</p

        <p
          >If you need to iterate over the properties of an object in a specific

        <h2>12. Abstraction</h2>
        <p
          >Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.
          It refers to the practice of hiding implementation details and
          exposing only the necessary information to the user. In other words,
          it allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does
          it.</p
        >
        <p
          >In JavaScript, we can achieve abstraction using constructor functions
          and prototypes. Let's take a look at an example:</p

        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function Circle(radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
      this.calculateArea = function() {
      return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
      };
      }</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we have a <span>Circle</span> constructor function
          that takes a <span>radius</span> parameter and assigns it to the
          <span>radius</span> property of the created object. We also have a
          <span>calculateArea</span> method that calculates the area of the
          circle.</p
        >
        <p
          >The implementation details of the <span>calculateArea</span> method
          are hidden from the user of the <span>Circle</span> object. The user
          only needs to know that the <span>calculateArea</span> method
          calculates the area of the circle, and does not need to know the
          details of how the calculation is performed.</p
        >
        <p
          >Abstraction helps us create objects that are easier to understand,

        <p
          >JavaScript does not provide a native way to declare private
          properties and methods in an object. However, we can use a technique
          called <em>closure</em> to achieve privacy.</p

          that takes a <span>radius</span> parameter and assigns it to the

          variables: <span>defaultLocation</span> and
          <span>computeOptimumLocation</span>, which are declared using the
          <code>let</code> keyword. These variables are not accessible from
          outside the <span>Circle</span> function.</p

        <p
          >The <span>draw</span> method is a public method that is accessible
          from outside the <span>Circle</span> function. It uses the
          <span>computeOptimumLocation</span> method, which is a private method
          that is not accessible from outside the <span>Circle</span> function.
          This way, we can hide implementation details and provide a clean and
          simple interface to the user of the <span>Circle</span> object.</p

        <h2>14. Getters and Setters</h2>
        <p
          >Getters and setters are functions that allow us to get or set the
          value of an object's properties. They are useful for controlling
          access to object properties and adding validation logic to the
          property values.</p
        >
        <p>Let's take a look at an example:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const person = {

        <p
          >In this example, we define a <span>person</span> object with two
          properties: <span>firstName</span> and <span>lastName</span>. We also
          define a <span>fullName</span> property, which is a getter and a
          setter function. The getter function returns the concatenated value of
          the <span>firstName</span> and <span>lastName</span> properties, while
          the setter function sets the value of the <span>firstName</span> and
          <span>lastName</span> properties based on the value passed to it.</p
        >
        <p
          >When we access the <span>fullName</span> property, the getter
          function is called and returns the full name of the person. When we
          set the <span>fullName</span> property, the setter function is called
          and updates the <span>firstName</span> and
          <span>lastName</span> properties accordingly.</p

        <p
          >Getters and setters are useful when we need to add additional logic

        <p
          >In JavaScript, every object has a prototype, which is an object that
          it inherits properties and methods from. When we try to access a
          property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks to see if
          that property or method exists on the object itself. If it doesn't,
          JavaScript looks for the property or method on the object's prototype,
          and so on up the prototype chain.</p

          to set up the prototype chain so that the `Circle` and `Square`
          objects inherit from the `Shape` object. We have added a `draw` method
          to the `Circle` prototype and overridden the `duplicate` method in the
          `Square` prototype.</p

        <p

          called the `duplicate` method on each shape. As expected, the
          `duplicate` method of the `Circle` object logs "duplicate" and the
          `duplicate` method of the `Square` object logs "duplicate square".

          properties, including whether a property is read-only, enumerable,

          the property is read-only, not enumerable, and cannot be deleted or
          modified using `delete` or `Object.defineProperty()`. We have then
          attempted to modify the `name` property, which throws an error in
          strict mode. Finally, we have logged the keys of the `person` object
          using `Object.keys()`, which returns an empty array because the `name`

          object using a constructor, the object's prototype is set to the
          constructor's `prototype` property. We can add properties and methods
          to the constructor's `prototype` property, and these properties and
          methods will be shared between all objects created with the

          that takes a `name` parameter and sets the `name` property of the
          object being created. We have then added a `greet()` method to the
          `Person.prototype` object, which logs a greeting message including the
          `name` property. We have then created two `Person` objects, `john` and
          `jane`, and called the `greet()` method on each object, which logs a
          greeting message including the object's `name` property.</p

        <h2>20. Prototype vs. Instance Members</h2>
        <p
          >In JavaScript, we can define properties and methods on an object's
          prototype, or directly on the object itself. Properties and methods
          defined on the object's prototype are shared between all objects
          created with the same constructor, while properties and methods
          defined directly on the object itself are unique to that object.</p
        >
        <p>Here is an example:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function Person(name) {
  // Instance property
  this.name = name;
}
// Prototype property
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
};

const john = new Person('John');
const jane = new Person('Jane');

john.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is John
jane.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Jane

// Set instance property
john.age = 30;

// Set prototype property
Person.prototype.sayAge = function() {
console.log(this.name + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old.');
};

john.sayAge(); // John is 30 years old.
jane.sayAge(); // Jane is undefined years old.
</code></pre>

        <p
          >In the example above, we have defined a `Person` constructor function
          that takes a `name` parameter and sets the `name` property of the
          object being created. We have then added a `sayHello()` method to the
          `Person.prototype` object, which logs a greeting message including the
          `name` property. We have then created two `Person` objects, `john` and
          `jane`, and called the `sayHello()` method on each object, which logs
          a greeting message including the object's `name` property.
        </p>
        <p
          >After that, we have set an instance property `age` on the `john`
          object, which is unique to that object. We have also added a
          `sayAge()` method to the `Person.prototype` object, which logs a
          message including the `name` and `age` properties of the object. When
          we call the `sayAge()` method on the `john` object, we get the
          expected result, but when we call it on the `jane` object, we get
          `undefined` for the `age` property because it was not set on that
          object.</p

        <h2>25. Calling the Super Constructor</h2>
        <p>
          In object-oriented programming, we often have a child object that
          needs to inherit from a parent object, but also needs to initialize
          its own properties. One way to do this is to call the constructor of
          the parent object from the child object using the
          <code>call</code> method or the <code>apply</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following example, we have a <code>Shape</code> parent object
          with a <code>color</code> property and a child object
          <code>Circle</code> that inherits from <code>Shape</code>.
          <code>Circle</code> has its own properties (<code>radius</code>), but
          we also want to initialize the <code>color</code> property of
          <code>Shape</code> in the <code>Circle</code> constructor. Here's how
          we can do that:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>function Shape(color) {
        this.color = color;
      }
      function Circle(color, radius) {
      Shape.call(this, color); // calling the constructor of the parent object
      this.radius = radius;
      }
      
      const circle = new Circle('red', 10);
      console.log(circle); // Output: Circle { color: "red", radius: 10 }</code></pre>

        <p>
          In the <code>Circle</code> constructor, we call the constructor of the
          <code>Shape</code> object using <code>Shape.call(this, color)</code>.
          The <code>this</code> keyword inside the
          <code>Shape</code> constructor refers to the new
          <code>Circle</code> object that we're creating, and the
          <code>color</code> argument is passed in to initialize the
          <code>color</code> property of the <code>Shape</code> object.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using this technique, we can easily extend the functionality of a
          parent object while also initializing the properties of the child
          object.

        <h2>26. Intermediate Function Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          Intermediate Function Inheritance is a technique used in JavaScript
          for implementing inheritance by creating a function that acts as an
          intermediate constructor. The intermediate function inherits from the
          parent constructor's prototype and adds new methods or properties to
          its own prototype. Child constructor functions are then created by
          inheriting from the intermediate function's prototype using
          Object.create() method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example of how to use intermediate function inheritance in
          JavaScript:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>
        function Shape() {}
        
        Shape.prototype.draw = function() {
          console.log('draw');
        }
        
        function Circle(radius) {
          this.radius = radius;
        }
        
        // Intermediate function
        function extend(Child, Parent) {
          Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
          Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
        }
        
        extend(Circle, Shape);
        
        Circle.prototype.draw = function() {
          console.log('draw circle with radius ' + this.radius);
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          In this example, we have a parent constructor function called Shape
          that has a prototype method called draw. We then create a child
          constructor function called Circle and pass it to an intermediate
          function called extend along with the parent constructor function
          Shape. The extend function sets the prototype of the child constructor
          function to a new object that is created with the parent constructor
          function's prototype, and then sets the constructor of the child
          constructor function to itself. Finally, we add a new draw method to
          the Circle constructor function's prototype, which overrides the draw
          method inherited from the Shape constructor function's prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using intermediate function inheritance, we can implement
          inheritance in JavaScript without having to use the ES6 class syntax
          or modify the prototype of built-in objects.

        <h2>27. Method Overriding</h2>
        <p
          >In object-oriented programming, method overriding is a feature that
          allows a subclass or child class to provide a different implementation
          of a method that is already defined in its superclass or parent class.
          This can be useful when we want to modify the behavior of a method in
          a subclass to suit its specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>Here is an example of method overriding in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>class Animal {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      
        makeSound() {
          console.log('The ' + this.name + ' makes a sound.');
        }
      }
      
      class Cat extends Animal {
        makeSound() {
          console.log('The ' + this.name + ' meows.');
        }
      }
      
      let animal = new Animal('animal');
      let cat = new Cat('cat');
      
      animal.makeSound(); // output: "The animal makes a sound."
      cat.makeSound(); // output: "The cat meows."</code></pre>
        <p
          >In this example, we have defined two classes: Animal and Cat. Cat is
          a subclass of Animal, so it inherits all the properties and methods of
          Animal. However, the makeSound() method in the Cat class overrides the
          makeSound() method in the Animal class. When we create an instance of
          the Cat class and call the makeSound() method, it will execute the
          implementation provided by the Cat class.</p

        <h2>28. Polymorphism</h2>
        <p
          >Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming where an
          object of a class can be treated as an object of any of its
          subclasses. It allows the same method or property of an object to
          behave differently depending on the type of object it is called on. In
          other words, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many
          forms.</p

      constructor(width, height) {
      super();
      this.width = width;
      this.height = height;

      class Circle extends Shape {
      constructor(radius) {
      super();
      this.radius = radius;
      }
      
      calculateArea() {
      return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
      }
      }
      
      // Create objects of different types and call the same method on them
      const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 5);
      const circle = new Circle(10);
      
      console.log(rectangle.calculateArea()); // Output: 50
      console.log(circle.calculateArea()); // Output: 314.1592653589793</code></pre>

          as it can also make our code more complex and difficult to
          maintain.</p
        >
        <h3>When to use inheritance:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li
            ><strong>Code reuse:</strong> Inheritance is useful when we want to
            create a new class that is similar to an existing class, but with
            some modifications or additions. By inheriting from the existing
            class, we can reuse the code that is already there and avoid
            duplicating it in the new class.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Inheritance can also be used to
            create abstract classes or interfaces, which define a set of methods
            or properties that a subclass must implement. This can help to
            enforce consistency and maintainability in our code.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Inheritance can also be used to
            implement polymorphism, which allows us to treat objects of
            different classes as if they were the same type. This can be useful
            when we have a collection of objects that share some common
            behavior, but also have some unique behavior.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <h3>When not to use inheritance:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li
            ><strong>Overuse:</strong> Inheritance can be overused, which can
            make our code more complex and difficult to maintain. We should only
            use inheritance when it makes sense, and when there is a clear
            benefit to doing so.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Tight coupling:</strong> Inheritance can also lead to tight
            coupling between classes, which can make our code less flexible and
            more difficult to change. We should strive to minimize coupling
            between classes, and use other design patterns (such as composition)
            when appropriate.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >Overall, inheritance can be a powerful tool for designing
          object-oriented programs. However, it should be used carefully and
          thoughtfully, and we should be aware of its benefits and drawbacks.</p

        <h2>30. Mixins</h2>
        <p
          >Mixins are a way to reuse code in multiple objects. A mixin is a
          function that takes an object and adds properties and methods to it.
          We can use mixins to extend objects without using inheritance.</p

        <p
          >In the above code, we have defined three mixins: canEat, canWalk, and

          function. The mixin function takes a target object and one or more
          source objects. It then adds the properties and methods of the source
          objects to the target object.</p

          reuse the code of the canEat mixin in both the Person and Fish
          objects, and we can also add the canSwim method to the Fish object.</p
        >
        <p
          >We have then created instances of the Person and Fish objects and

          <h2>31. ES6 Classes</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a new syntax for creating classes in
          JavaScript. Classes provide a way to define object blueprints, also
          known as templates for creating objects. In previous versions of
          JavaScript, classes were created using constructor functions and
          prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          ES6 classes are syntactical sugar over the previous way of creating
          classes using constructor functions and prototypes. They make the
          syntax for creating classes more similar to that used in other
          object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++. The syntax
          for creating a class in JavaScript is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">class MyClass {
          constructor() {
            // constructor code here
          }
        method1() {
        // method code here
        }
        
        method2() {
        // method code here
        }
        }</code></pre>

        <p>
          The class keyword is used to create a new class. The name of the class
          is provided after the class keyword. In the example above, the class
          is named MyClass. The body of the class is contained within curly
          braces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constructor method is a special method that is called when an
          instance of the class is created. It is used to set up the initial
          state of the object. In the example above, the constructor method is
          empty, but it could be used to initialize instance variables or
          perform other setup tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other methods in the class are defined using standard function
          syntax. In the example above, the class has two methods, method1 and
          method2.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a new instance of a class, the new keyword is used followed
          by the name of the class and any arguments that should be passed to
          the constructor. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const myObject = new MyClass();</code></pre>
        <p>
          The myObject variable now contains an instance of the MyClass class.
          The methods defined in the class can be called on this object just
          like any other object in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          ES6 classes also support inheritance. To create a subclass that
          inherits from a parent class, the extends keyword is used followed by
          the name of the parent class. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">class MySubclass extends MyClass {
          constructor() {
            super();
            // subclass constructor code here
          }
        method3() {
        // method code here
        }
        }</code></pre>

        <p>
          In the example above, MySubclass is a subclass of MyClass. It inherits
          all of the methods from MyClass, including the constructor method. The
          constructor method in MySubclass calls the constructor method in
          MyClass using the super keyword. The subclass can then define its own
          methods, such as method3.
        </p>
        <p>
          ES6 classes are a useful tool for organizing and structuring code in a
          more object-oriented way. They provide a familiar syntax for
          developers who are used to working with classes in other languages,
          and they make it easier to create objects that have the same
          properties and behavior.

        <header><h2>32. Hoisting</h2></header>
        <p
          >Hoisting is a term used in JavaScript to describe the behavior of
          variable and function declarations being moved to the top of their
          respective scopes during the compilation phase of the program's
          execution.</p
        >
        <h3>Variable Hoisting</h3>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, variable declarations are "hoisted" to the top of their
          respective scopes, regardless of where the actual declaration is made.
          However, the variable assignment remains in its original place.
        </p>
        <h3>Function Hoisting</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to variable hoisting, JavaScript also hoists function
          declarations to the top of their respective scopes. This means that a
          function can be called before it is declared, and the JavaScript
          interpreter will still be able to find it. However, function
          expressions, which are defined using an anonymous function assigned to
          a variable, are not hoisted.</p
        >
        <h3>Block Scoping</h3>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, variables declared with the `let` and `const` keywords
          are not hoisted to the top of their respective scopes like variables
          declared with the `var` keyword. Instead, they have block-level scope
          and are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.</p
        >
        <h3>Benefits and Drawbacks of Hoisting</h3>
        <p>
          Hoisting can make code easier to read and write by allowing developers
          to declare variables and functions in a logical order that reflects
          their intended usage. However, hoisting can also lead to unexpected
          behavior and bugs if not used carefully. It is generally recommended
          to declare variables and functions at the beginning of their
          respective scopes to avoid potential hoisting-related issues.</p

          <h2>33. Static Methods</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          In object-oriented programming, static methods are methods that belong
          to the class instead of instances of the class. They are defined with
          the static keyword and are accessed using the class name instead of an
          instance of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, static methods are introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and
          are now available in modern web browsers. Prior to ES6, there was no
          built-in way to create static methods in JavaScript classes.
        </p>
        <p> Here's an example of a static method in a class: </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        class Circle {
          constructor(radius) {
            this.radius = radius;
          }
        static createFromDiameter(diameter) {
        return new Circle(diameter / 2);
        }
        
        get area() {
        return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
        }
        }
        
        const circle = new Circle(10);
        console.log(circle.area); // 314.1592653589793
        
        const circle2 = Circle.createFromDiameter(10);
        console.log(circle2.area); // 78.53981633974483
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          In this example, we have a Circle class that has a static method
          called createFromDiameter. This method creates a new Circle instance
          using the diameter of the circle instead of the radius. The method
          takes the diameter as a parameter, calculates the radius, and then
          returns a new Circle instance using the radius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that we call the createFromDiameter method using the Circle
          class name, not an instance of the Circle class. This is because the
          method belongs to the class, not to any instance of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Static methods are useful when we want to define utility methods that
          are related to the class but don't require an instance of the class to
          be created. They can be used for things like creating new instances of
          the class from different inputs or performing some kind of calculation
          related to the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that static methods cannot access instance
          properties or methods of the class, only static properties and
          methods. This is because they do not have access to the instance
          context, which is the this keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, static methods are a powerful tool for organizing
          related functionality within a class and providing utility methods
          that don't require an instance of the class to be created.

          <h2>34. The This Keyword</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, the <code>this</code> keyword is a special keyword that
          refers to the object that the function is a property of. The
          <code>this</code> keyword can take different values depending on how
          the function is called.
        </p>
        <h3>Global Scope</h3>
        <p>
          If the <code>this</code> keyword is used outside of any function, it
          refers to the global object. In a browser environment, the global
          object is the <code>window</code> object.
        </p>
        <h3>Function Scope</h3>
        <p>
          If the <code>this</code> keyword is used inside a function, its value
          depends on how the function is called. If the function is called as a
          standalone function, the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to the
          global object.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        function myFunction() {
          console.log(this); // logs the global object (window in a browser)
        }
        myFunction();
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          If the function is called as a method of an object, the
          <code>this</code> keyword will refer to the object that the method is
          a property of.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        const myObject = {
          myMethod: function() {
            console.log(this); // logs myObject
          }
        };
        myObject.myMethod();
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Constructor Function Scope</h3>
        <p>
          If a function is used as a constructor function (i.e. with the
          <code>new</code> keyword), the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to
          the new object being created.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        function Person(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
        const john = new Person('John');
        console.log(john.name); // logs "John"
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Explicitly Setting the This Keyword</h3>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, you can explicitly set the value of the
          <code>this</code> keyword using the <code>call</code>,
          <code>apply</code>, or <code>bind</code> methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> methods are used to call
          a function with a specified <code>this</code> value and arguments. The
          difference between them is the way arguments are passed to the
          function. In the <code>call</code> method, arguments are passed
          individually, while in the <code>apply</code> method, arguments are
          passed as an array.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        function myFunction() {
          console.log(this);
        }
        myFunction.call('hello'); // logs "hello"
        myFunction.apply('world'); // logs "world"
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          The <code>bind</code> method returns a new function with the
          <code>this</code> value set to the specified value. This is useful for
          creating new functions that use the same <code>this</code> value.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        const myObject = {
          myMethod: function() {
            console.log(this);
          }
        };
        const myFunction = myObject.myMethod.bind(myObject);
        
        myFunction(); // logs myObject

        <h2>35. Private Members Using Symbols</h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, until the introduction of ES6, there was no built-in
          support for private members. However, with the advent of ES6, the
          language introduced a new type of object called Symbols, which can be
          used to create private members in an object. A Symbol is an immutable
          primitive value that is unique and can be used as a property key for
          objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a private member using Symbols, we can declare a Symbol
          property on an object and use that as a reference to a private
          property or method. The Symbol property can be accessed only by code
          inside the object and cannot be accessed from outside the object.
          Let's look at an example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            const _radius = Symbol();
            const _draw = Symbol();
            class Circle {
              constructor(radius) {
                  this[_radius] = radius;
              }
      
              [_draw]() {
                  console.log('drawing a circle');
              }
          }
      
          const c = new Circle(10);
          console.log(c); // Circle { [_radius]: 10 }
          c[_draw](); // drawing a circle
          console.log(c._radius); // undefined
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          In the above example, we have declared two Symbols, _radius and _draw,
          and used them to create a private radius property and a private _draw
          method in the Circle class. Notice that we have used square brackets
          to create a computed property name with the Symbol reference inside
          it. This allows us to use the Symbol as a property name.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we create a new Circle object, we can see that the _radius
          property is added to the object as expected. However, when we try to
          access the _radius property using the dot notation, we get undefined,
          since the Symbol property is not accessible from outside the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we can call the private _draw method using the Symbol
          reference inside square brackets. This is a powerful feature of
          Symbols, as it allows us to create truly private members in JavaScript
          classes.

        <h2>36. Private Members Using WeakMaps</h2>
        <p
          >One limitation of using symbols for private members is that they are
          still accessible through object introspection. This means that if you
          have a reference to the object, you can access its private members. A
          more robust solution for private members is to use WeakMaps. A WeakMap
          is a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are objects and the
          values can be any type of value. The key objects are weakly
          referenced, meaning that they can be garbage collected if there are no
          other references to them. This makes WeakMaps ideal for implementing
          private members, as the private members will be automatically garbage
          collected when the object is garbage collected.</p
        >
        <p
          >Here's an example of how to use WeakMaps to implement private
          members:</p
        >
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const _radius = new WeakMap();
        
        class Circle {
          constructor(radius) {
            _radius.set(this, radius);
          }
        
          draw() {
            console.log(`Circle with radius ${_radius.get(this)}`);
          }
        }
        
        const c = new Circle(1);
        c.draw(); // output: Circle with radius 1
        
        console.log(_radius.get(c)); // output: undefined</code></pre>
        <p
          >In this example, the private member <code>_radius</code> is a WeakMap
          that stores the radius of the circle for each instance of the Circle
          class. The constructor sets the value of <code>_radius</code> for the
          current instance using <code>_radius.set(this, radius)</code>, and the
          <code>draw</code> method uses <code>_radius.get(this)</code> to
          retrieve the radius for the current instance. Note that the private
          member cannot be accessed outside of the class using
          <code>_radius.get(c)</code>, as <code>_radius</code> is not defined
          outside of the class.</p
        >
        <p
          >Using WeakMaps for private members ensures that they are truly
          private and cannot be accessed outside of the class. However, it's
          worth noting that this comes with a performance cost, as WeakMaps are
          less performant than regular object properties. As with any
          performance optimization, it's important to balance the benefits of
          using private members with the cost of reduced performance.</p

        <h2>37. Method Riding</h2>
        <p>
          Method riding is a concept in object-oriented programming where you
          can override an existing method of a parent class in a subclass. In
          JavaScript, method riding can be achieved using prototypical
          inheritance, ES6 classes, or constructor functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you override a method in a subclass, the subclass's
          implementation of the method is used instead of the parent class's
          implementation when that method is called on an object of the
          subclass. This allows you to provide a specialized implementation of a
          method for a specific class or set of classes, while still inheriting
          the common behavior from the parent class.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, suppose you have a class called `Animal` with a method
          called `makeSound` that returns the string "generic animal sound".
          Now, suppose you have a subclass of `Animal` called `Cat` and you want
          to make the `Cat` class return a different sound from the `Animal`
          class. You can override the `makeSound` method in the `Cat` class to
          return a different sound:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    class Animal {
      makeSound() {
        return "generic animal sound";
      }
    }
    class Cat extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
    return "meow";
    }
    }
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          In this example, when you call makeSound on an object of the Cat
          class, the implementation of makeSound in the Cat class is used
          instead of the implementation in the Animal class. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    const cat = new Cat();
    console.log(cat.makeSound()); // "meow"
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          Method riding is a powerful concept that allows you to customize the
          behavior of classes while still leveraging the common functionality
          provided by parent classes. However, it can also lead to complex
          inheritance hierarchies if used excessively, so it's important to use
          it judiciously.

        <h2>38. Modules</h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, modules are a way to organize code into separate files,
          making it easier to manage and maintain large codebases. A module is
          simply a JavaScript file that exports one or more objects, functions,
          or values that can be imported by other modules. Each module has its
          own scope, which means that any variables or functions declared within
          a module are not visible outside of that module unless explicitly
          exported.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several ways to create modules in JavaScript, including the
          CommonJS and AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) formats. However,
          since the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript has its
          own built-in module system, which is now widely supported by modern
          browsers and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the ES6 module system, each file is treated as a separate module,
          and you can export and import objects and functions using the
          <code>export</code> and <code>import</code> statements respectively.
          When you import a module, its code is executed only once, and the
          exported objects are cached for later use. This means that you can
          safely import the same module from different parts of your code
          without worrying about duplicated code or state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ES6 module system also supports named exports and default exports.
          Named exports allow you to export multiple objects or functions from a
          module under different names, while the default export allows you to
          export a single object or function as the default value of the module.
          When importing a default export, you can choose any name you want,
          whereas named exports must be imported under their original names.
        </p>

        <h2>39. CommonJS Modules</h2>
        <p
          >CommonJS modules were one of the first module systems developed for
          JavaScript, designed to work on the server-side with Node.js. It
          provides a way to structure JavaScript code in a modular way, making
          it easier to manage and reuse.</p
        >
        <p
          >CommonJS modules use a simple syntax to export and import code
          between files. In order to export a module, you simply assign the
          values or functions you want to export to the
          <code>module.exports</code> object. For example:</p
        >
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // greet.js
        function greet(name) {
          console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
        }
        module.exports = { greet };
        </code></pre>

        <p
          >In the example above, we define a function <code>greet</code> and
          then assign it to the <code>module.exports</code> object, making it
          available to other modules.</p
        >
        <p
          >To import this module in another file, we use the
          <code>require</code> function, which returns the exported module. For
          example:</p
        >
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // app.js
        const { greet } = require('./greet');
        greet('John');
        </code></pre>

        <p
          >In the example above, we use the <code>require</code> function to
          import the <code>greet</code> function from the
          <code>greet.js</code> module. We then call the
          <code>greet</code> function with the argument 'John', which will log
          the message 'Hello, John!' to the console.</p
        >
        <p
          >CommonJS modules have some limitations, including their synchronous
          nature, which can make them less suitable for use in browser
          environments. However, they are still widely used in Node.js and can
          be a good choice for structuring code in server-side applications.</p

      <article>
        <h2>40. ES6 Modules</h2>
        <p
          >ES6 introduced a new way of defining and exporting modules using the
          <code>export</code> and <code>import</code> statements. This is a
          standardized way of modularizing JavaScript code and is now widely
          supported by modern web browsers and Node.js.</p
        >
        <h3>Exporting Modules</h3>
        <p
          >The <code>export</code> keyword is used to export a module from a
          file. There are two ways to export a module:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><strong>Named exports:</strong> One or more named exports can be
            exported using the <code>export</code> keyword. These exports can
            then be imported in other modules using their respective names.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Default export:</strong> A single default export can be
            exported using the <code>export default</code> syntax. This export
            can then be imported in other modules using any name of the
            programmer's choice.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an example of exporting a module using named exports:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // math.js
        
        export const add = (a, b) =&gt; a + b;
        export const subtract = (a, b) =&gt; a - b;
        </code></pre>
        <p
          >And here's an example of exporting a module using a default
          export:</p
        >
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // greet.js
        
        export default name =&gt; `Hello, ${name}!`;
        </code></pre>
        <h2>41. Importing Modules</h2>
        <p
          >The <code>import</code> keyword is used to import modules in a file.
          Here are a few ways to use the <code>import</code> keyword:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            ><strong>Importing named exports:</strong> A named export can be
            imported using its respective name.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Importing a default export:</strong> A default export can
            be imported using any name of the programmer's choice.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Importing all exports as an object:</strong> All exports
            from a module can be imported as an object using the
            <code>*</code> wildcard character.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an example of importing named exports:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // app.js
        
        import { add, subtract } from './math.js';
        
        console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
        console.log(subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3
        </code></pre>
        <p>And here's an example of importing a default export:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // app.js
        
        import greet from './greet.js';
        
        console.log(greet('John')); // Output: Hello, John!
        </code></pre>
        <p>Finally, here's an example of importing all exports as an object:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        // app.js
        
        import * as math from './math.js';
        
        console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
        console.log(math.subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p
          >ES6 modules provide a standardized way of defining and exporting
          modules in JavaScript. This helps improve the organization and
          maintainability of code by making it more modular and reusable. It
          also helps to avoid naming conflicts between different parts of the
          code.

        <h2>42. ES6 Tooling</h2>
        <p>
          ES6 Tooling refers to the various tools and libraries available to
          developers to aid in the development and deployment of ES6 (ECMAScript
          2015) applications. Before ES6, developers used libraries such as
          jQuery, Underscore, and Lodash to work with the DOM and perform common
          utility functions. However, with the introduction of ES6, many of
          these features were built into the language itself, making it easier
          to write modern, efficient, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          ES6 Tooling includes various tools such as transpilers, bundlers, and
          package managers that make it easier to write and deploy modern
          JavaScript applications. Transpilers such as Babel can be used to
          convert ES6 code into ES5 code, which is compatible with older
          browsers that do not support ES6 natively. This allows developers to
          write code using the latest features of ES6 while still ensuring
          backward compatibility with older browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bundlers such as Webpack can be used to package and bundle code,
          allowing developers to split their code into smaller modules and load
          only the required modules when necessary. This helps to reduce the
          load time of the application and improve performance. Package managers
          such as NPM and Yarn can be used to manage dependencies and install
          third-party libraries required for the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          ES6 Tooling also includes various development environments and editors
          such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text, which have plugins
          and extensions that support ES6 development. These tools provide
          features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging,
          making it easier for developers to write and debug ES6 code.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, ES6 Tooling plays a crucial role in modern web
          development, providing developers with the necessary tools and
          libraries to write efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.

        <h2>42. Babel</h2>
        <p>
          Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that can transform code written
          in modern ECMAScript standards to backward-compatible versions of
          JavaScript that can be run in older browsers. Babel can convert the
          latest JavaScript syntax into a version of JavaScript that is
          compatible with most browsers, even those that are several years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Babel's main function is to take code written using the latest
          ECMAScript standards and transpile it to an older, more
          widely-supported version. Babel can also add polyfills and other
          features that allow modern JavaScript code to be executed in older
          browsers that don't support the latest features natively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Babel can be used as a standalone tool or as a part of a larger
          development toolchain. It integrates easily with other JavaScript
          tools and can be used to optimize, debug, and test JavaScript code.
          Babel is highly configurable, allowing developers to customize its
          behavior to match their specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Babel is a powerful tool that enables developers to write
          modern, clean JavaScript code that can be executed in almost any
          browser, regardless of its age or level of support for newer
          JavaScript features.

          <h2>43. Webpack</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Webpack is a popular open-source module bundler for modern JavaScript
          applications. It allows developers to manage and organize their code
          into modules, and then bundles them together into a single file for
          deployment. Webpack provides a powerful set of features for managing
          dependencies, optimizing code, and enabling hot reloading for faster
          development. It is highly configurable and can be customized to fit a
          wide range of use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Webpack can be used to build a variety of projects, including simple
          static websites, single-page applications, and complex enterprise
          applications. It is especially useful for modern web development
          workflows that require multiple build steps and pre-processing tools.
          With Webpack, developers can write their code in a modular,
          maintainable way, and then let the tool handle the heavy lifting of
          bundling and optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Webpack is based on a plugin architecture, which allows developers to
          add or modify its functionality to fit their specific needs. It
          supports a wide range of plugins for things like code splitting, tree
          shaking, and optimizing images and other assets. Additionally, Webpack
          integrates with many other popular development tools and frameworks,
          such as Babel, TypeScript, React, and Vue.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key benefits of Webpack is its ability to handle complex
          dependency graphs. It can automatically resolve and load dependencies,
          even for complex projects with multiple entry points and deep nested
          imports. Webpack can also perform advanced optimizations like code
          splitting, which allows applications to load only the code they need
          when they need it, resulting in faster load times and better
          performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, Webpack is a powerful tool for managing dependencies,
          bundling code, and optimizing JavaScript applications. It is highly
          configurable and can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases,
          making it an essential tool for modern web development workflows.
