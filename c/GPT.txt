I recently finished my C# course. So I need to create a note.
I will give you a title and you should write a short note including code examples for me. 
I need to put those notes in my website so, notes should be written in HTML. 

Here is your institutions :

Note should be inside a HTML <article> element.
If you need to write a title, use <h2 tag> like, <h2>Title goes here</h2>.
Other text shound be inside <p> tag like <P>text goes here</p>.
If you need a line braek, use two <br/> tags.
If you need to write a code exmple, use this : <pre class="language-csharp"><code>Code goes here</code></pre>.
If you need to add list, use <ol> and <li> tags.
Use <span> for one line of code, instead of <code> tag

My first title is "19. Understanding HTML Attributes".
