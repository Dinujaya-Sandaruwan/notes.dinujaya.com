        <h2>01. What is Sass?</h2>
        <p
          >Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or
          compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sass extends CSS with
          features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making
          it easier to write and maintain CSS code.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to define a variable in Sass:</p>
        <pre class="language-sass"><code>$primary-color: #3498db;</code></pre>
        <p>You can then use the variable in your styles:</p>
        <pre class="language-sass"><code>body {
        background-color: $primary-color;
}</code></pre>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>02. Compiling Sass with VS Code extensions</h2>
        <p
          >You can use various extensions in Visual Studio Code to compile Sass
          code into CSS. One popular extension is the "Live Sass Compiler"
          extension. Here are the steps to set up the extension:</p
        >
        <ol>
          <li
            >Open Visual Studio Code and click on the "Extensions" icon in the
            left-hand sidebar.</li
          >
          <li
            >Search for "Live Sass Compiler" and click on the "Install"
            button.</li
          >
          <li
            >Once the extension is installed, click on the "Settings" icon in
            the left-hand sidebar.</li
          >
          <li
            >Search for "Live Sass Compiler Config" and click on "Edit in
            settings.json".</li
          >
          <li>Add the following configuration to the settings.json file:</li>
        </ol>
        <pre class="language-sass"><code>{
        "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
          {
            "format": "compressed",
            "extensionName": ".min.css",
            "savePath": "/css"
          }
        ]
}</code></pre>
        <p
          >This configuration tells the extension to compile Sass into minified
          CSS and save it in the "/css" directory.</p
        >
        <p
          >Once you have set up the extension, you can start writing Sass code
          in your project and the extension will automatically compile it into
          CSS.</p
        >

        <h2>03. Sass Partials</h2>
        <p
          >Sass partials are separate Sass files that contain snippets of CSS
          code. They are called "partials" because their filenames start with an
          underscore "_" character, which tells Sass not to compile them into
          standalone CSS files.</p
        >
        <p
          >Here's an example of a partial file called "_variables.scss" that
          contains variables:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>// _variables.scss
$primary-color: #3498db;
$secondary-color: #2ecc71;</code></pre>
        <p
          >You can import this partial file into your main Sass file using the
          @import directive:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>// main.scss
@import 'variables';
body {
      background-color: $primary-color;
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >When you compile the main.scss file, Sass will automatically include
          the variables defined in the "_variables.scss" partial.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>04. Sass Variables and CSS Custom Properties</h2>
        <p
          >Sass variables and CSS custom properties are both used to store and
          reuse values in CSS code. While they serve a similar purpose, there
          are some differences between the two.</p
        >
        <p
          >Sass variables are defined in Sass code using the "$" symbol, while
          CSS custom properties are defined in CSS code using the "--"
          symbol.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of defining a Sass variable:</p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>$primary-color: #3498db;
body {
    background-color: $primary-color;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Here's an example of defining a CSS custom property:</p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>:root {
    --primary-color: #3498db;
}
body {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >Note that CSS custom properties can also be used in Sass code, but
          they must be wrapped in the "var()" function:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>$primary-color: var(--primary-color);
body {
    background-color: $primary-color;
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >Using variables and custom properties can make your CSS code more
          flexible and easier to maintain.</p

        <h2>05. Sass and BEM</h2>
        <p
          >Sass and BEM (Block Element Modifier) are two popular approaches to
          writing modular and maintainable CSS code.</p
        >
        <p
          >BEM is a naming convention for CSS classes that helps to ensure
          consistency and modularity. BEM classes are made up of three parts:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >The block: A standalone component that can be reused across
            different parts of a website. Block names are written in lowercase
            and separated by hyphens (e.g. "menu-item").</li
          >
          <li
            >The element: A part of a block that has no standalone meaning.
            Element names are written in lowercase and separated from the block
            name by a double underscore (e.g. "menu-item__link").</li
          >
          <li
            >The modifier: A variant or extension of a block or element.
            Modifier names are written in lowercase and separated from the block
            or element name by a double hyphen (e.g.
            "menu-item__link--active").</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an example of using BEM classes in Sass code:</p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>.menu-item {
        background-color: #f1f1f1;
      &__link {
      color: #333;
      text-decoration: none;
      &--active {
        color: #fff;
        background-color: #3498db;
      }
    }
  }</code></pre>

        <p
          >This Sass code defines a "menu-item" block with an
          "element__modifier" structure for the link element. The "&" symbol is
          used to reference the parent class in Sass code.</p
        >
        <p
          >Using BEM with Sass can help to keep your CSS code organized and
          maintainable.</p

        <h2>06. Building the Responsive Mobile</h2>
        <p
          >Building a responsive mobile design is an important part of modern
          web development. Here are some tips for building a responsive mobile
          design with Sass:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >Use Sass variables for commonly used values such as font sizes,
            colors, and spacing. This makes it easier to adjust these values for
            different screen sizes.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. Sass
            makes it easy to write media queries with its "@media"
            directive.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use the "rem" unit for font sizes and "em" units for spacing. These
            units are relative to the root font size and make it easier to
            maintain consistent proportions across different screen sizes.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use the "mobile first" approach, which means designing for mobile
            screens first and then adding styles for larger screens. This helps
            to ensure that your design is optimized for smaller screens.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >Here's an example of using Sass variables and media queries for a
          responsive mobile design:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>$primary-color: #3498db;
$font-size: 16px;
body {
    font-size: $font-size;
    color: #333;
    
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      font-size: $font-size * 1.2;
    }
    
    @media (min-width: 992px) {
      font-size: $font-size * 1.5;
    }
    
    @media (min-width: 1200px) {
      font-size: $font-size * 1.8;
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >This Sass code defines a variable for the primary color and a
          variable for the base font size. It also uses media queries to adjust
          the font size for different screen sizes.</p
        >
        <p

        <h2>07. Building the Desktop Layout</h2>
        <p
          >Building a desktop layout requires a different approach than building
          a mobile layout. Here are some tips for building a desktop layout with
          Sass:</p
        >
        <ul>
          <li
            >Use a grid system to lay out your content. Sass has many grid
            systems available as libraries or you can create your own using CSS
            Grid or Flexbox.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. Sass
            makes it easy to write media queries with its "@media"
            directive.</li
          >
          <li
            >Use the "em" unit for spacing to ensure that your layout scales
            proportionally with changes in font size.</li
          >
          <li>Use Sass mixins to simplify repetitive CSS code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p
          >Here's an example of using a Sass mixin to create a desktop
          layout:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>$grid-columns: 12;
$grid-gutter: 20px;
@mixin grid-container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 $grid-gutter / 2;
}

@mixin grid-column($columns) {
  width: 100% / $grid-columns * $columns;

}</code></pre>

        <p
          >This Sass code defines a grid system with a 12-column layout and 20px
          gutters. It also uses media queries to adjust the column widths for
          different screen sizes.</p

        <h2>10. Setting Widths</h2>
        <p
          >Sass makes it easy to set widths for your elements using variables
          and mixins. Here's an example:</p
        >
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>$max-width: 1200px;
.container {
  max-width: $max-width;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.sidebar {
  width: 25%;
  @include breakpoint(md) {
    width: 33.33%;
  }
}

.content {
  width: 75%;
  @include breakpoint(md) {
    width: 66.66%;
  }
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we define a variable for the maximum width of our
          container. We then use that variable to set the maximum width and
          margin of the container.</p
        >
        <p
          >Next, we set the width of our sidebar and content elements. We use a
          mixin called "breakpoint" to adjust the widths for different screen
          sizes. The "breakpoint" mixin is defined elsewhere in our Sass code
          and generates media queries.</p
        >
        <p
          >By using variables and mixins in this way, we can quickly and easily
          adjust the widths of our elements and ensure that they scale properly
          on different screen sizes.</p
        >
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>09. Sass Mixins</h2>
        <p
          >Sass mixins are a powerful way to reduce code duplication in your
          CSS. Mixins allow you to define a block of CSS code and then include
          it in multiple places throughout your stylesheet.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to create and use a Sass mixin:</p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>@mixin button($bg-color, $text-color) {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: $bg-color;
  color: $text-color;
  border-radius: 4px;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background-color: darken($bg-color, 10%);
  }

  &:active {
    background-color: darken($bg-color, 20%);
  }
  }

  .button-primary {
    @include button(#0074D9, #FFFFFF);
  }

  .button-secondary {
    @include button(#FFFFFF, #0074D9);
  }</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we define a mixin called "button" that takes two
          parameters: the background color and text color for the button. The
          mixin includes all of the common styles for a button, such as padding,
          border-radius, and font-size.</p
        >
        <p
          >We can then include the "button" mixin in our ".button-primary" and
          ".button-secondary" classes, passing in the appropriate background and
          text colors as parameters. This results in clean, readable code and
          makes it easy to update the styles for all of our buttons at once by
          simply changing the mixin.</p

        <h2>10. Responsive Typography</h2>
        <p
          >Responsive typography is an important aspect of building responsive
          websites. Sass makes it easy to set up responsive typography using
          mixins and functions.</p
        >
        <p
          >Here's an example of how to use Sass to create a responsive
          typography system:</p
        >
        <pre

h2 {
  @include font-size(36px);
}

p {
  @include font-size(16px);

        <p
          >In this example, we define a function called "calculate-rem" that
          calculates the size of a font in rem units based on a given context.
          We then define a mixin called "font-size" that takes a font size and
          line height as parameters and sets the font size and line height using
          both pixels and rem units.</p
        >
        <p
          >We can then use the "font-size" mixin to set the font size and line
          height for our headings and paragraphs. By using both pixels and rem

          ems, respectively.</p

        <h2>12. Why I Use Em Units in Media Queries</h2>
        <p
          >Using em units in media queries can provide some advantages over
          using pixels or other units. Em units are relative to the font size of
          the element they are applied to, which makes them more flexible and
          easier to work with when designing responsive websites.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to use em units in a media query:</p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>// Define breakpoint
$breakpoint: 768px;
// Apply media query using em units
@media screen and (min-width: em($breakpoint)) {
  // Styles for larger screens
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we define a breakpoint at 768 pixels and use the
          "em" function to convert this value to em units. We then use the em
          unit breakpoint in our media query, which means that the breakpoint
          will be based on the font size of the element it is applied to.</p
        >
        <p
          >Using em units in media queries can also make it easier to work with
          nested elements. When using pixels, nested elements inherit the pixel
          value of their parent, which can make it difficult to create
          responsive designs. However, when using em units, nested elements will
          inherit the font size of their parent, which can make it easier to
          create responsive designs that scale properly on different screen
          sizes.</p
        >
        <p
          >Overall, using em units in media queries can make it easier to create
          flexible and responsive designs that work well on different screen
          sizes.</p

        <h2>13. Nesting and BEM</h2>
        <p
          >BEM is a popular naming convention for CSS classes that helps make
          code more modular and maintainable. One of the benefits of BEM is that
          it makes it easy to nest classes and create more complex, modular
          designs.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to use BEM and nesting in Sass:</p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>// BEM class names
.block {
    &__element {
      // Styles for element
    }
    &--modifier {
    // Styles for modifier
    }

    &--modifier &__element {
    // Styles for modifier on element
    }
  }

  // Example of nested BEM class
  .header {
  &__logo {
  // Styles for logo
  }

  &__nav {
    // Styles for navigation
    &__item {
    // Styles for navigation item
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

        <p
          >In this example, we define BEM class names for a block, element, and
          modifier. We use the "&" symbol to reference the parent selector,
          which allows us to create nested classes for modifiers and elements.
          We also show an example of how to use nested BEM classes for a header
          element that contains a logo and navigation.</p
        >
        <p
          >Using BEM and nesting can help make your code more modular and
          maintainable by breaking it down into smaller, reusable pieces. This
          can make it easier to manage larger codebases and create more complex
          designs that are easy to modify and update.</p

        <h2>14. Helper/Utility Classes</h2>
        <p
          >Helper or utility classes are CSS classes that are designed to
          perform a specific function or apply a specific style to an element.
          They are typically used to help style common elements or provide
          shortcuts for commonly-used styles.</p
        >
        <p>Here's an example of how to create helper classes in Sass:</p>
        <pre class="language-scss"><code>// Helper class to center an element
.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
// Helper class to hide an element
.hide {
  display: none;
}

// Example of using helper classes
      
<div class="center hide">
This element is centered and hidden
</div></code></pre>
        <p
          >In this example, we create two helper classes: one to center an
          element using flexbox, and one to hide an element by setting its
          display property to "none". We then show an example of how to use
          these helper classes in HTML by applying both classes to a div
          element.</p
        >
        <p
          >Using helper or utility classes can help make your code more modular
          and maintainable by providing a set of pre-defined styles that can be
          easily applied to elements. This can make it easier to manage larger
          codebases and ensure consistent styling across your website or
          application.</p
